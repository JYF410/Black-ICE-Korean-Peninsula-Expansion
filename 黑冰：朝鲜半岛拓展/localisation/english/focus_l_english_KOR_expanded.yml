Through this act, Japan achieved the so-called 'Annexation of Japan and Korea.' Following the signing, the Residency-General was reorganized into the Government-General of Chosun, the supreme governing body reporting directly to the Japanese Emperor. The Governor-General held absolute power over legislation, justice, and administration. The treaty marked the end of Korean sovereignty, reducing the nation to a complete colony."

This was significantly higher than the rates seen in colonial Taiwan.\nFurthermore, the colonial authorities integrated police power with traditional self-governing structures, such as the Baojia system and the local authority of village headmen. This allowed the police to penetrate society more deeply, enforcing state policy far more thoroughly than during the Joseon era.
