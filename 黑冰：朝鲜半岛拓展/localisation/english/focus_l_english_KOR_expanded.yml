 KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty:5 "Korean Peninsula Independence Movement"
 KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty_desc:5 "On August 22, 1910, under Japanese military угрозes, Japan’s Resident‑General of Korea, Terauchi Masatake, coerced Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan‑yong to sign in Hanseong (modern Seoul). Through this treaty, Japan carried out the so‑called “Japan–Korea Annexation.” After the signing, Japan renamed the Residency‑General to the Governor‑General of Korea, the highest authority for ruling Korea, controlling all state affairs. The Governor‑General answered directly to the Japanese Emperor and held legislative, judicial, and administrative power. The treaty reduced Korea to a Japanese colony and ended Korean sovereignty."

 KOR_CHI_restoration_movement:5 "“Guidelines for Assisting the Korean National Restoration Movement”"
 KOR_CHI_restoration_movement_desc:5 "To strengthen aid to Korea, on July 20, 1942, the KMT Central Executive Committee’s Standing Committee decided to form a special group to comprehensively study assistance to Korea, appointing Dai Jitao, He Yingqin, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Zhu Jiahua, Wu Tiecheng, and Wang Shijie as members, with Wu Tiecheng and Wang Chonghui as conveners. In the same month, the Military Affairs Commission was ordered to draft the “Guidelines for Assisting and Utilizing Korean Revolutionary Forces in China,” consisting of 3 sections and 15 articles.\nFor Korean independence activists, beyond moral support, China also provided extensive financial assistance. For requests from parties led by Kim Koo, Kim Yak‑san, and the Provisional Government of Korea, China was almost always accommodating. At times, Chiang Kai‑shek even specifically instructed: “No need to audit, to avoid injuring their self‑respect.”"

 Korean_Liberation_Army_desc:5 "The Korean Liberation Army was an anti‑Japanese restoration force established by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Chongqing on September 17, 1940, initially with about 300 members. Its first commander‑in‑chief was Lee Cheong‑cheon. The force was directly under the Military Affairs Commission of the Nationalist Government and carried five core tasks: intelligence gathering, enemy‑rear propaganda, persuasion of Japanese troops to defect, and more. In 1942 it merged with the Korean Volunteer Army and expanded into a six‑tier structure. While in China, it participated in the main Chinese fronts and the China–Burma–India theater. By 1945 it had grown to nearly 2,000 members, many of whom later became core figures in building the Republic of Korea’s government and armed forces."

 KOR_restore_society:5 "Patriotic Restoration Association"
 KOR_restore_society_desc:5 "The Patriotic Restoration Association was the first permanent anti‑Japanese national united front on the Korean Peninsula and a powerful underground revolutionary organization. Its founder and leader was Kim Il‑sung. It was established in Northeast China, with its network and subordinate groups spread across the Korean Peninsula and large parts of Northeast China, and even in Japan. The organization and its branches steadily carried out armed anti‑Japanese संघर्ष in various ways."
 KOR_front_against_Japan:5 "Korean National Front Alliance"
 KOR_front_against_Japan_desc:5 "In October 1937, to defeat Japanese imperialism, a national united front was formed in China by four groups with different beliefs and guiding ideologies: the Korean National Revolutionary Party (nationalist group), the Korean National Liberation League (communist group), the Korean Youth Vanguard League (Marxist‑guided group), and the League of Korean Revolutionaries (anarchist group). They formed the “Korean National Front Alliance.” As the war situation worsened, in February 1938 Japan promulgated the “Korean Conscription Ordinance” and established “Korean Conscription Special Training Centers” in Beiping and Tianjin, forcibly recruiting Koreans in occupied North China to form “security corps” and “resident corps” in major cities of the occupied zones, turning them into cannon fodder for its war of aggression. This further enraged the Korean people, and the Korean Volunteer Corps gradually formed."

The unit comprised four infantry battalions and one radio battalion, with command led by Brigade Commander Zhou Baozhong, Political Deputy Brigade Commander Li Zhaolin, and Soviet liaison officer Wang Xinlin, among others.\nKim Il‑sung served as commander of the 1st Battalion. This unit was the seed of the Northeast Anti‑Japanese United Army and China’s first special forces using Soviet equipment — an armed special operations force. Over the following years, it repeatedly crossed the border to conduct raids, sabotage, and reconnaissance, demonstrating the presence of Chinese resistance in the Northeast.\nAfter entering the USSR, Kim Il‑sung also led multiple incursions, including missions to search for Wei Zhengmin (returning after confirmation of Wei’s death). In August 1945, when the Allies launched a full offensive against the Kwantung Army in the Northeast, the brigade’s soldiers took part; Kim Il‑sung later received the Soviet Order of the Red Banner for his anti‑Japanese service."

 KOR_PRC_support_northeast_democratic_army_desc:5 "In the early stage of the War of Liberation, the troops often lacked weapons and ammunition. When Chen Yun and Xiao Jinguang visited Korea, they requested arms support for the PLA. Kim Il‑sung directly provided the Northeast forces with 100,000 rifles and large quantities of explosives produced by the Hungnam fertilizer plant in Hamhung. All of these were given to the Northeast forces. At that time Korea’s economy was weak, yet Kim Il‑sung still provided enough cloth to make nearly ten thousand uniforms and a truckload of medicine. The other side was sincere and considerate in every way."

 KOR_PRC_General_Federation_of_Korean_Chinese_desc:5 "At the time, a federation of overseas Chinese in Korea also supported the homeland’s Northeast Liberation War. After victory in the War of Resistance, there were about 50–60 thousand Chinese in Korea, including over 20 thousand in northern Korea. After consultation between the CCP Central Committee and the Korean Workers’ Party Central Committee, the General Federation of Korean‑Chinese was established in Pyongyang in November 1946, with its leadership body简称 “Hualian Federation.” At the same time, branch federations were set up in provinces and counties with sizable Chinese communities; some local branches even created sub‑organizations, such as the “Overseas Chinese Children’s Corps” (founded in 1947) under the Sinuiju branch.\nThe Hualian Federation was jointly led by the Korean Workers’ Party Central Committee and the CCP Northeast Bureau Pyongyang Office. It administered provincial, city, and county federations, the Xinhua Bookstore, and its official newspaper, “Democratic Overseas Chinese.”\nIts early tasks included: internationalist and patriotic education among the overseas Chinese;宣传 the policies of the Korean party and government; educating overseas Chinese to love Korea, abide by Korean laws and policies, and actively participate in local建设;宣传 the CCP’s call to “Overthrow Chiang Kai‑shek and liberate all of China” and the favorable situation in the domestic liberation war; promoting traditional Sino‑Korean friendship and harmonious relations between overseas Chinese and the Korean people; safeguarding overseas Chinese interests and cultivating local cadres."

Japan promoted the “Greater East Asia Co‑Prosperity Sphere,” calling on Koreans to devote themselves to the “Greater East Asia Holy War,” intensifying assimilation propaganda."

 KOR_JAP_office_governor:5 "Governor‑General of Korea"
 KOR_JAP_office_governor_desc:5 "With the annexation of Korea in August 1910, Japan created an administrative body to govern Korea. It was established in Keijō and based on the “Governor‑General of Korea” ordinance promulgated in September 1910, which consolidated and reformed the various departments of the Korean government. The Governor‑General was supported by an inspector‑general’s office under a political inspector‑assistant and five departments: General Affairs, Internal Affairs, Finance, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, and Justice, as well as subordinate bodies including police and courts.\nMajor revisions occurred in August 1919 and December 1943. In 1919, influenced by the March 1st Independence Movement, the limits of autocratic rule became clear, and the policy shifted toward “cultural politics.” The appointment scope of the Governor‑General expanded to include civilians, and the command authority of the Army and Navy was abolished, though civilians never actually became Governors‑General. The organization was also reorganized, abolishing the Police Inspector‑General and provincial police bureaus; the constitutional police system was abolished, but the number of police bureaus and stations increased.\nIn the 1943 reform, the Interior Minister could provide the Governor‑General with “unified necessary support” and adjusted with changes in the central government, such as the establishment of a Munitions Ministry. Despite these reforms, the system’s nature as military‑backed colonial rule did not change."
 KOR_national_bank:5 "Bank of Korea"
 KOR_national_bank_desc:5 "After the Japan‑Korea annexation, in 1911 the bank was renamed the “Bank of Korea” under the Bank of Korea Act (Japanese law: Meiji 44, March 29, Law No. 48, promulgated March 29 and effective August 15), becoming a special bank. It issued Bank of Korea notes from 1910 to 1945, and from 1945 to 1950 issued the Korean won for the Republic of Korea, before being dissolved in 1950. It was replaced by the Bank of Korea in the Republic of Korea and the Central Bank in the DPRK."
 KOR_bank_note:5 "Bank of Korea Notes"
 KOR_bank_note_desc:5 "The official currency name of the Bank of Korea notes was the Korean yen, used during Japanese rule in Korea and also circulating in Manchukuo and the Kwantung Leased Territory. “Bank of Korea notes” refers to the legal banknotes printed by the Bank of Korea for use in colonial Korea. The design featured Jurojin, one of Japan’s Seven Lucky Gods, modeled on Kim Yun‑sik, and was nicknamed “old‑man notes” in Northeast China.\nThe notes were equivalent in value to the Japanese yen and Taiwan Bank notes, and were a currency issued by the Japanese government specifically for the Korean Peninsula. The basic unit was the yen, with 1 yen equal to 100 sen. These notes replaced the Korean Empire won in 1910 and were finally replaced in 1945 by the old Korean won and the Korean yen respectively."

As Korea’s largest fertilizer plant, it produced more than 800,000 tons at its peak and was a comprehensive fertilizer base."
