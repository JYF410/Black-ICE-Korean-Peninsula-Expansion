 KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty_desc:0 "On August 22, 1910, under the threat of military force, Japanese Resident-General Terauchi Masatake coerced Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-yong into signing the annexation treaty in Hanseong (Seoul). Through this act, Japan achieved the so-called 'Annexation of Japan and Korea.' Following the signing, the Residency-General was reorganized into the Government-General of Chosun, the supreme governing body reporting directly to the Japanese Emperor. The Governor-General held absolute power over legislation, justice, and administration. The treaty marked the end of Korean sovereignty, reducing the nation to a complete colony."

In May 1939, they issued a joint declaration calling for all factions to set aside ideological differences and concentrate their strength against the Japanese."
