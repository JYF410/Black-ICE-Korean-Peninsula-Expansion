KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty:5 "Korean Peninsula Independence Movement"
KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty_desc:5 "On August 22, 1910, under Japanese military pressure, Terauchi Masatake, the Japanese Resident-General of Korea, coerced Korean Prime Minister Yi Wan-yong into signing the treaty in Hanseong (present-day Seoul). Through this treaty, Japan carried out the so-called “Japan–Korea Annexation.” After its signing, the Japanese Residency-General was renamed the Government-General of Korea, becoming the supreme authority governing the peninsula. The Governor-General, directly appointed by the Emperor of Japan, controlled legislative, judicial, and administrative powers. The treaty reduced Korea to a full Japanese colony and marked the loss of national sovereignty."
