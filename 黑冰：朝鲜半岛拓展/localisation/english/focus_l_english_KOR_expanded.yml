KOR_Japan_Korea_Annexation_Treaty_desc:0 "On August 22, 1910, under the threat of Japanese military force, Terauchi Masatake, the Japanese Resident-General of Korea, coerced Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-yong into signing this treaty in Hanseong (now Seoul). Through this treaty, Japan achieved the so-called 'Annexation of Japan and Korea.' Following the signing, the Japanese Residency-General was renamed the Government-General of Chosun, serving as the supreme governing body with authority over all state affairs. The Governor-General reported directly to the Japanese Emperor and controlled the legislative, judicial, and administrative branches of Korea. The treaty reduced Korea to a complete colony, marking the fall of the nation."

KOR_CHI_Restoration_Front_desc:0 "In August 1937, the Korean National Party led by Kim Ku joined with eight other groups, including the Korean Revolutionary Party and the Korean Independence Party, to form the Federation of Korean Restoration Movement Organizations in Nanjing, known as the 'Restoration Front.' By November, the Korean National Revolutionary Party and the League of Korean Revolutionaries formed the Korean National United Front, or 'National Front.' In January 1938, the two factions met in Changsha to discuss unification but failed to reach an agreement.\n\nIn January 1939, Chiang Kai-shek met with Kim Ku and Kim Won-bong (Kim Yak-san) separately, urging them to cooperate sincerely against Japan for Korean independence. Chiang later tasked Zhu Jiahua, Director of the KMT Central Organization Department, with ensuring their internal unity. In May of that year, Kim Ku and Kim Won-bong issued a joint declaration, admitting to past mistakes and calling for all groups to cease partisan activities and concentrate their strength regardless of ideology."

Their core tasks included intelligence gathering, behind-the-lines propaganda, and instigating desertion among Japanese troops. After merging with the Korean Volunteer Army in 1942, it expanded into a six-tier military system. During their time in China, they fought on the front lines and in the Burma-India theater. By 1945, the force grew to nearly 2,000 members, who later became the core founders of the ROK government and military."
