KOR_CHI_Korea_Reconquista:5 "Republic of Korea Restoration Movement"
KOR_CHI_Korea_Reconquista_desc:5 "In the early stages of the Korean independence movement, numerous factions emerged and regrouped over time, eventually forming two major forces: the Korean National Party led by Kim Ku and the Korean National Revolutionary Party led by Kim Won-bong. During the early years of the War of Resistance, discord between the two hindered the development of the independence movement. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek met separately with both leaders, urging them to cooperate openly against Japan in pursuit of Korean independence. In May 1939, Kim Ku and Kim Won-bong jointly issued an 'Open Letter to Comrades and Compatriots,' calling upon all Korean parties and factions to set aside their differences and unite."
