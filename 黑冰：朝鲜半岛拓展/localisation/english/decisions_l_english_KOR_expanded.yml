 KOR_CHI_Korea_Reconquista_desc:0 "On April 29, 1932, Yun Bong-gil of the Korea Independence Party detonated a bomb at a Japanese celebration of the Emperor's birthday in Shanghai's Hongkew Park. The blast killed and wounded several high-ranking Japanese military and political officials, including Shirakawa Yoshinori and Shigemitsu Mamoru, shocking the world. This act served as a major turning point in Sino-Korean relations, instantly dissolving the emotional rift caused by the earlier Wanbaoshan Incident. Consequently, the Korean independence movement’s strategic importance within the KMT's anti-Japanese plans rose sharply, leading the highest levels of the Chinese government to take a direct interest in the Korean cause."
