 KOR_CHI_Korea_Reconquista_desc:0 "On April 29, 1932, Yun Bong-gil of the Korea Independence Party detonated a bomb at a Japanese celebration of the Emperor's birthday in Shanghai's Hongkew Park. The blast killed and wounded several high-ranking Japanese military and political officials, including Shirakawa Yoshinori and Shigemitsu Mamoru, shocking the world. This act served as a major turning point in Sino-Korean relations, instantly dissolving the emotional rift caused by the earlier Wanbaoshan Incident. Consequently, the Korean independence movement’s strategic importance within the KMT's anti-Japanese plans rose sharply, leading the highest levels of the Chinese government to take a direct interest in the Korean cause."

 KOR_USA_Order_frigate_desc:0 "The PC-461-class submarine chaser was a class of naval vessels developed by the United States Navy during World War II. Between 1941 and 1944, a total of 343 PC-461-class ships were produced. Under the Lend-Lease Act, 46 of these vessels were transferred to allied nations, while another 59 were converted into other types of patrol craft. Eight of these ships were lost in combat, including one after its conversion to a PGM-9 motor gunboat. Notably, PC-566, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Herbert G. Claudius, was the only one of its class credited with sinking a German U-boat (U-166). Following the war, the United States transferred a significant number of these surplus chasers to the Republic of Korea and the Republic of China to bolster their fledgling navies."

In the Northeast, various Korean anti-Japanese factions—long persistent in their struggle—seized the opportunity to rebuild their strength. Forces such as the anti-Japanese guerrillas founded by Kim Il-sung and the Korean Revolutionary Army led by Ji Cheong-cheon fought side-by-side with Chinese anti-Japanese volunteer armies to strike back against the Japanese invaders."

This aid was vital in alleviating material shortages and maintaining the combat effectiveness of the front-line troops. This support reflects the deep friendship and solidarity between the two peoples, contributing significantly to the victory in Northeast China."
