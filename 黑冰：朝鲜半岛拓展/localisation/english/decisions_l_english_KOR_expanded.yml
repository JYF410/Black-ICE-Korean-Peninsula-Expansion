Thereafter, the revolutionary armed struggle of the Korean people developed rapidly. Within only a few months, the organization spread throughout Korea, with tens of thousands of members. In March 1937, Kim Il-sung convened a meeting at Xigang in Jilin, China, proposing a strategic guideline for advancing into Korea proper and formulating the operational plan for the Battle of Pochonbo."

Korea not only supplied large quantities of weapons, ammunition, uniforms, and medical supplies free of charge, but also delivered substantial amounts of food and other daily necessities through trade channels. This assistance played a crucial role in alleviating material shortages and sustaining the combat effectiveness of frontline forces. Korean support reflected the deep friendship and spirit of solidarity and cooperation between the two peoples, making a significant contribution to the victory of the Northeast Liberation War."
