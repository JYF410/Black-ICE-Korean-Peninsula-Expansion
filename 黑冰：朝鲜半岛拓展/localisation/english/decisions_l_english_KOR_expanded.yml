 KOR_CHI_Korea_Reconquista_desc:0 "In the early stages of the Korean independence movement, numerous factions formed and dissolved. Eventually, two main groups emerged: the Korea National Party, led by Kim Ku, and the Korean National Revolutionary Party, led by Kim Won-bong. Early friction between these two factions hindered the movement's progress. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek met with both leaders, urging them to cooperate sincerely against Japan. In May 1939, Kim Ku and Kim Won-bong published an 'Open Letter to Comrades and Compatriots,' calling for all Korean parties to set aside past grievances and work together for the common goal of independence."
