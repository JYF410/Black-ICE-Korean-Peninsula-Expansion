POLITICS_Kim_Koo_DESC:0 "Kim Koo was the leader of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. He devoted his life to the independence and reunification of his homeland and is honored in South Korea as the 'Father of the Nation' and the 'Heart of the Korean Independence Movement.' When the March First Movement broke out, Kim learned that many independence activists were organizing the Provisional Government in Shanghai. He arrived there in April of the same year and was appointed Chief of Police of the Provisional Government. In 1926, he became the head of state, serving as the highest leader of the Provisional Government.\nIn 1931, when the Korean independence movement was at a low point, Kim founded the Korean Patriotic Organization in Shanghai to conduct assassination operations against high-ranking Japanese officials, serving as its leader. The most famous operation was the 1932 Hongkou Park bombing carried out by Yun Bong-gil. Prior to the operation, Kim arranged for Chinese technicians to produce bomb devices disguised as lunchboxes and water flasks, demonstrating his close ties with Chinese revolutionaries.\nThe Korean independence movement led by Kim received strong support from the Chinese Nationalist Government. Chiang Kai-shek agreed in 1933 to establish a special class for Korean independence fighters at the Luoyang branch of the Central Military Academy, providing military training and substantial material support. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Kim merged the Korean National Party, the Korean Independence Party, and the Korean Revolutionary Party into the 'Korean Liberation Front,' cooperating with Nationalist Chinese forces against Japan. In 1940, with support from the Kuomintang, he established the Korean Liberation Army in Chongqing, launching a series of guerrilla operations against Japanese forces.\nAfter Japan’s defeat in 1945, Korea was liberated. Kim prepared to return home with members of the Provisional Government. Before his departure, Chinese Nationalist and Communist leaders—including Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Ching-ling, Zhou Enlai, and Dong Biwu—each hosted farewell banquets in his honor. After returning, Kim continued striving to establish an independent, sovereign, and unified state on the Korean Peninsula until he was assassinated in 1949 by right-wing Army Second Lieutenant Ahn Doo-hee."
