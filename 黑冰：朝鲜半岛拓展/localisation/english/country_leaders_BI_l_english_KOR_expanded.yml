 POLITICS_Park_Heon_young_DESC:0 "The leader of the 'Domestic Faction,' Pak Hon-yong revived the Communist Party of Korea following the end of WWII—which had been previously dissolved under Japanese pressure—and served as its Chairman.

 POLITICS_Kim_Koo_DESC:0 "Kim Koo was the preeminent leader of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Having dedicated his life to national independence and unification, he is revered by Koreans as the 'Father of the Nation' and the 'Heart of the Independence Movement.' After the March 1st Movement, he arrived in Shanghai in April 1919 and was appointed Commissioner of the Police Bureau. By 1926, he became the leader of the Provisional Government as the President of the State Council.\n\nIn 1931, during a low point for the movement, Kim established the 'Korea Patriotic Corps' (Hanin Aegokdan) to conduct high-profile assassinations of Japanese officials, most notably the 1932 Hongkew Park bombing carried out by Yun Bong-gil. Kim’s deep ties with Chinese revolutionaries were evident when he collaborated with Chinese technicians to craft the specialized 'lunchbox' and 'water bottle' bombs used in the attack.\n\nHis movement received significant backing from the Chinese Nationalist Government. In 1933, Chiang Kai-shek authorized a special Korean training class at the Luoyang branch of the Central Military Academy to cultivate military talent. Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Kim merged various parties into the 'Korea Restoration Front' to cooperate with the NRA. In 1940, with KMT support, he founded the Korean Liberation Army in Chongqing to wage guerrilla warfare. After Japan's defeat in 1945, Kim was honored with farewell banquets by figures as diverse as Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Ching-ling, and Zhou Enlai before returning home. He continued to work for a unified, independent Korea until his assassination by army lieutenant Ahn Doo-hee in 1949."

 POLITICS_Syngman_Rhee_DESC:0 "A 'living fossil' of Korean history, Syngman Rhee was born into the Korean Royal Clan and educated in the United States. He was a founding member of the Provisional Government and became the first President of the Republic of Korea after WWII. His iron-fisted rule eventually sparked massive public outrage, leading to his exile and eventual death in Hawaii, ending a life that bore witness to the peninsula's most turbulent era."

 POLITICS_Minami_Jiro_DESC:0 "A General in the Imperial Japanese Army, Minami Jiro was a key player in the Mukden and North China Incidents. Appointed Governor-General of Korea in 1936, his tenure lasted until 1942. His rule was significantly harsher than his predecessors, as he systematically dismantled the liberal reforms of the 1920s. He banned all Korean-language newspapers and aggressively pushed the 'Soshi-kaimei' policy (the adoption of Japanese names). After his service in Korea, he led the Dai-Nippon Seijikai and served in the House of Peers."

 POLITICS_Abe_Nobuyuki_DESC:0 "Born in Kanazawa to a samurai family, Abe Nobuyuki rose through the ranks of the Army to hold senior positions in the General Staff and the War Ministry. He served as Vice-Minister of War in 1928 and briefly as acting War Minister. Despite serving as Prime Minister in 1939, his cabinet was viewed as weak; his failure to establish a Ministry of Trade and his lack of military support led to his resignation after only five months. In 1944, he was appointed the last Governor-General of Korea. Though designated a Class-A war convict after the war, he was never formally charged."

 POLITICS_Kim_Wonbong_DESC:0 "A central figure in the independence movement, Kim Won-bong (Kim Yak-san) was the leader of the Heroic Corps (Uiyeoldan), Commander of the Korean Volunteer Corps, and Deputy Commander of the Korean Liberation Army. In 1932, he established the Korean Revolutionary Military and Political Academy in Nanjing with the approval of Chiang Kai-shek, training 125 officers. In 1938, he formed the 'Korean Volunteer Corps' in Hankou, which fought alongside the NRA in the Battle of Wuhan and other major campaigns. Although a long-time critic of the Provisional Government, he joined forces with Kim Ku in 1939 under Chiang's mediation. After the founding of the DPRK, he held several high-ranking ministerial posts but was eventually purged in 1958 during the crackdown on the 'South Korean Labor Party' and 'Yanan' factions."

 Portrait_KOR_Hegai_DESC:0 "Aleksei Ivanovich Hegai (Ho Ka-i) was a prominent Soviet-Korean politician and a founding leader of the Soviet faction within the Workers' Party of Korea. Born in Khabarovsk, he rose to prominence as a party secretary in Uzbekistan before being dispatched to Korea under Stalin's orders to assist in state-building. By 1946, he was elected to the Political Committee. Although he contributed greatly to the foundation of the party, his poor command of the Korean language hindered his influence among the grassroots leadership. During the Korean War, he clashed with Kim Il-sung over party reorganization and mass-line theories. Following a series of political attacks and a demotion to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs, Hegai was found dead in a Pyongyang bunker in July 1953, having committed suicide after being targeted for purging."
