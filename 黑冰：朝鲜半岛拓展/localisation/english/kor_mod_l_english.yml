Several months later, left-wing groups led by Kim Won-bong—including the Korean National Revolutionary Party, the Korean National Liberation League, and the League of Korean Revolutionaries—formed the “Korean National Front Alliance” in Wuhan, known as the National Front. Gathering intelligence behind enemy lines and promoting resistance among overseas Korean communities became the most fundamental tasks of the Provisional Government.

The proposal stated that assistance to Korean revolutionary forces in China should be carried out with “enthusiastic, magnanimous, and impartial support”; that “in utilizing multiple parties, one should not insist on a single party and must enable cooperation among them”; and that “the Korean Provisional Government should be enabled to lead all parties, implement democratic politics, and avoid monopolization by a single party,” while “considering international circumstances and recognizing it at an appropriate time.” On August 1, the Central Assistance-to-Korea Group held its first meeting, deciding: (1) in principle to recognize the Korean Provisional Government before other nations, timing to be determined by the government; (2) before formal recognition, only one organization could be acknowledged as counterpart; (3) loans to Korean revolutionary forces in China would be handled by the Party under principles of magnanimity and freedom. Subsequent meetings determined that political and administrative coordination would be overseen by the Party’s Secretariat, recognition timing would be decided by Chiang, and one million yuan would be allocated to support Korean revolutionary forces."

KOR_communism.1.t:0 "The Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland Is Officially Established"
KOR_communism.1.d:0 "Led by General Kim Il-sung, the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland did not represent the interests of any single class or stratum, but upheld the genuine demands and interests of the entire people. Under Kim Il-sung’s chairmanship, it brought together many prominent patriots and revolutionaries, including Kim Chaek and Choe Yong-gon. Despite differences in political stance and ideology, these communists and patriots united to overthrow their common enemy—Japanese imperialism—and establish national independence. Through mass organization, the Association became the foundation of Kim Il-sung’s anti-Japanese guerrilla struggle, striking severe blows against Japanese imperialism until the very end. Due to Japanese “pacification” campaigns, tens of thousands of members were arrested or sacrificed. Alongside its development, the Association conducted vigorous propaganda to inspire anti-Japanese consciousness and patriotism, secretly publishing journals such as the “March First” monthly and “Hwat’ae Min,” as well as numerous pamphlets and leaflets."
