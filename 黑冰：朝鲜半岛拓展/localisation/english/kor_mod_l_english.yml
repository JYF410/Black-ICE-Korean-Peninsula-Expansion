 KOR_communism.1.t:0 "The Fatherland Restoration Association Is Officially Established"
 KOR_communism.1.d:0 "The Fatherland Restoration Association, led by General Kim Il-sung, did not represent the interests of any single class or social stratum. Instead, it upheld the concrete demands and interests of the entire people. Under the chairmanship of General Kim Il-sung, the Association brought together many well-known patriotic revolutionaries, including Kim Chaek and Choe Yong-gon. Although these communists and patriotic figures differed in political positions and ideological views, they united in their common goal: to overthrow the rule of their shared enemy—Japanese imperialism—and to establish an independent national state for their homeland.\n\nBy organizing the masses, the Fatherland Restoration Association became the foundation of the armed guerrilla struggle led by General Kim Il-sung, delivering heavy blows against the bandit-like Japanese imperialists until the very end. From its first day, this anti-Japanese national united front unfolded in brutal struggle against the enemy. As a result of Japan’s so-called 'pacification campaigns,' tens of thousands of Association members and patriots were arrested, imprisoned, or killed.\n\nAlongside the expansion of the organization and the intensification of armed resistance, extensive propaganda efforts were carried out to awaken national consciousness and patriotic spirit among the people. The Fatherland Restoration Association secretly published its own journals, including the monthly 'Sam-il' and 'Hwatyeonmin' (an underground publication within Korea), as well as numerous pamphlets and leaflets distributed through mimeograph printing, forming a powerful propaganda campaign."

 KOR_communism.2.t:0 "The Battle of Pochonbo Breaks Out"
 KOR_communism.2.d:0 "On June 4, 1937, under the direct command of Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Revolutionary Army broke through the blockade along the Sino–Korean border and entered Pochonbo, located on the banks of the Yalu River in northern Ryanggang Province. The force attacked and burned Japanese colonial police stations, administrative offices, forestry management offices, and agricultural experiment stations, destroying enemy units and capturing large quantities of military supplies, weapons, and ammunition. Documents and propaganda materials issued by the Fatherland Restoration Association—including the 'Ten-Point Program' and the 'Appeal to the Korean People'—were posted throughout the streets of Pochonbo.\n\nKim Il-sung addressed the population, calling on all anti-Japanese patriotic forces to unite in the struggle to liberate the homeland and resist Japanese imperialism. His speech left a profound impression on the local populace."
